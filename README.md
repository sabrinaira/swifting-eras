> Last Updated: June 02, 2025

> This was my first solo project based on my spreadsheet passion project that collects one of my favorite music artist's discography. I will no longer be continuing to update this version of this application, but instead rebuild it with a different database that is better suitable for the data structure and design. - Sabrina


#### Key Features:

- **Album Browsing**: Explore a collection of Taylor Swiftâ€™s albums with details like release year and song count.
- **Song Insights**: View detailed song information, including track numbers, duration, and lyrics.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Smooth transitions between albums, songs, and additional app sections using client-side routing.

#### Purpose:

The app serves as both an interactive tool for Taylor Swift fans and a demonstration of modern web development practices. It was built with a focus on responsiveness, usability, and clean design.
